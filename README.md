## 🧑‍💻 About Me
I started in tech at the age of 13, trading work for courses at a computer school. Soon after, I was teaching classes and diving deeper into the world of IT.

I work as a Full Stack Odoo Developer and DevOps specialist, leveraging tools like Docker, Kubernetes, and AWS to optimize deployment and scalability.
My focus is on streamlining business processes, automating workflows, and delivering robust ERP solutions using Odoo.
I enjoy working closely with clients and teams to translate complex requirements into practical, sustainable code that makes a real impact.

I'm also passionate about languages — I speak English fluently and am currently studying Arabic and Mandarin.
